# World Population Growth Analysis

This repository contains Python code for analyzing and visualizing world population growth using data from [The World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/).

## Dataset

The dataset used in this analysis contains annual population growth rates for various countries from 1960 to 2022.

### Data Source
- [The World Bank Population Growth (annual) Dataset](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SP.POP.GROW)

## Analysis

### Descriptive Questions
- **What is the median population growth rate globally over the years?**
- **Which year had the highest population growth rate globally, and why did it happen?**
- **How does the population growth rate vary between high-income and low-income countries?**

### Diagnostic Questions
- **Which countries had the lowest population growth rates in 2019, and why did it happen?**
- **Which countries have population growth rates that are unusually high or low compared to the majority of countries?**

### Predictive Questions
- **What might be the population growth rate trends for the next few years?**

### Visualization
- Visualizations include line plots, box plots, and heatmaps to represent the population growth trends and outliers.

## Repository Structure
- `population_growth_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing the Python code for data analysis and visualization.
- `The_World_Bank_Population_growth_(annual_).csv`: Dataset used for analysis.
